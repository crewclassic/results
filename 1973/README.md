# 1973 Navy Racing information

In August 2022 David Kucik, a member of the 1973 Navy Crew, emailed
the Crew Classic with information about Navy's participation in the
inagural race in Mission Bay.

In this directory are copies of the information that Mr. Kucik
provided.

## Finish time discrepancy resolution

Upon review of the recap information provided it was noted that there
were two finish times that did not match the Crew Classic's
records. Mr. Kucik and Dan O'Neill of the Crew Classic discussed and
resolved the discrepancy. **The Crew Classic's 1973 results are
correct.**

* In the Men's Junior Varsity 8+ the Crew Classic records show Navy
finishing in 6:25.8 just a couple of seconds behind Washington. In
the recap, the finish time is listed as 6:35.8, 10 seconds
slower. Mr. Kucik agreed upon finish time is 6:25.8 and that the Navy
recap potentially contains a typo.
* In the Varsity Four's all times match except for the 5th place winner,
Long Beach. In our records we show LB finishing at 8:06.3 and in the
recap it is 8:08.3. The Crew Classic records are considered correct at
8:06.3 for Long Beach in this event.
